        review: "A really intense bank robbery movie with Elliot Gould and Christopher Plummer. Gould a teller at the bank is stealing money under the counter when Plummer robs the bank. A young John Candy also appears. The cat and mouse between Gould and an evil Plummer is riveting. Be for warned though that there is a really gruesome scene towards the end."

Almost every part except Douglass' could have been played by their WW counterpart and the movie still would have been just as good. I think that a major issue With West Wing besides the post Sorkin era, is that the pilot plays less like a continuation of The American President an more like slamming on the brakes."

        review: "I was really surprised how much I liked this movie. Theres underlying politics but unlike most modern movies they don't overpower the actual story itself. Modern writers seem to think that they are the first generation to bring politics into movies, but thats ignorance on their part. Writers from older generations were just as political, they were just better at burying the message so that you came to the realization yourself. Rather than spending 2 hours preaching to the converted and turning off anybody who's mind you could change. A great cast, its  like a great crock pot meal. Almost everyone in this movie by themselves would make any movie their in better. Makes me want to go bak and watch Clue."
