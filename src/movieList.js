I love The Conversation, so the idea that this is a soft sequel makes very happy. What seemed far fetched in 1998, 20 years later society caught up to this movie."

It almost seem modest now. It really almost impossible to see anyone other than Martin and Charlie Sheen play their parts. Douglas is firing on all cylinders. I'm not sure will ever find out how many yachts can you water-ski behind"

It also is the perfect runtime, 90 minutes. It also allow for some ambiguity if you watch it another way. I can almost guarantee that Clive Owen got parts in the 00's from people in the industry who saw this film."

Clockers has a lot of the things that make Spike films great and limits some of the things that can be over used like the dolly shot. I might even recommend this to someone who hadn't seen a Spike Lee movie even before Do the Right Thing. The video game part it not good though."

The two actors going at each other while the tension rises keeps you on the edge of your seat. Tony Scott's directing makes this still even today seem like a very modern movie."

The movie comes out so quickly. 4 years after Watergate and 1 1/2 years after Nixon resigns, and gets you up to the 1972 Election. In a way you the viewer are dangling on a time thread in the middle.  "

        review: "Alian Delon play a cop this time. The movie has a blue tint to it that adds atmosphere. The opening in the rain is gorgeous. This is Melville's last film.  In the last scene of the last Melville film Delon is crying. "
